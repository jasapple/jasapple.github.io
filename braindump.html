            <span style="padding-left: 3em;"> + Break Trainees into three 'groups': Audio Engineers, Broadcast Engineers, Computer Engineers. Allow them to overlap (like a 3 circle venn diagram). Center is CE/SE's skill level. Broadcast and Audio have a lot of overlap while Audio and Computer will not have as much. Show that there is a balance and allow trainees to pursue whatever interest group they want.</span>
